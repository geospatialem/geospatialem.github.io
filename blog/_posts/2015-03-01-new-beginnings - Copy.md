It's been a while but we've got the same name just a different place... Now, on to the updates since my last post, back in 2013 (yikes).

1. I've got a *'new gig'*... as in I started it shortly after my last post, so while it's "old news" it's also *'new'* (sure, why not). I hung up my field boots for JavaScript libraries and couldn't be happier.

2. The last few months have been challenging but they have also been **_extremely rewarding_**. *(More on that in future posts).*

3. In 2014, I served as the Conference Chair for the <a href="www.mngislis.org">Minnesota GIS/LIS Consortium's</a> annual conference. I had the backing of an **_amazing_** team and we accomplished some really cool things. *Expect some "recaps" or references in future posts.* 

4. In January 2015 I was selected to serve a two-year term on the <a href="www.urisa.org/about-us/vanguard-cabinet">URISA Vanguard Committee</a> focusing on students and young professionals in the geospatial and URISA communities.

5. I also coach hockey in the winter, hike in the summer, skate wherever there is free ice and love talking with fellow colleagues after work hours. *Expect future posts on these topics as I find a lot of my inspiration comes from these moments and carries over into my professional career.*

**Okay, you get the point.** *It's been two years and life has happened.*

Long story long... I hope to tell the tale of a geospatial developer; the up's the down's, the successes the failures, and everything in between.
